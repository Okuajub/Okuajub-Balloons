A balloon originally started for Etc. Jam 2024 (which had a Halloween theme) which I didn't finish on time. Whoops. Anyway, TEN THOUSAND DRACULAS UPON YE.

Check out the Lite version if the old timey font isn't readable enough. Honestly the balloon isn't meant to be SUPER practical, I just wanted to create something pretty.
